# Human3.6-Occluded: Dataset Augmentation for Occluded Human Pose Estimation

This repository provides code for generating an occluded version of the Human3.6M dataset.
We take object and animals images from the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset as occluders. Considering the four available camera views for each scene in the dataset, we partially cover the subject's body on three out of four views.
An occluded view includes two random objects pasted over the human bounding box. Object size and location inside the box are chosen at random.
